<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>INSTRUCTIONS :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. Cut about a 3-inch wide pocket into the thick side of each breast almost to the other side, but do not cut all the way through. Season both sides of each breast with kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper.<br />2. Heat oil &amp; butter in a large skillet over medium-low heat. Turn the heat to medium.<br />3. Place the spinach in the skillet and saut&eacute; the spinach about 30 seconds, just long enough to wilt but not burn. Dab the spinach on a paper towel to remove excess oil.<br />4. In a medium bowl, mix the cheese and spinach until combined. Stuff the chicken breasts with the spinach/cheese mixture and secure the breasts with toothpicks.<br />5. Place the breasts in the hot skillet and leave for 4 minutes or until the chicken turns golden brown. Carefully turn the breasts over and cook another 3 minutes or until golden brown.<br />6. Reduce heat to low, cover and cook another 3-5 minutes or until the meat is no longer pink in the middle. A meat thermometer should read 160&deg;F when placed in the thickest part of the meat.<br />7. Enjoy.</p>
