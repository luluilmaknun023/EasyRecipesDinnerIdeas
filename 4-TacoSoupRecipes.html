<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Notes :</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">1. *This is also good with 1/3 cup chopped bell pepper in place of jalapeno if you want it more mild. Or just omit and don't replace and it will be fine.<br />2. **For a stronger spiced flavor double up all of the spices.<br />3. ***I first shared this recipe 5 years ago and since people have loved it as is I didn't want to tweak it. But personally I now omit the ranch mix and add 1/3 cup chopped cilantro and 1 Tbsp lime in at the end and I like it better this way.</p>
